            <div class="description">
                <p>Jameson is by far the best selling Irish whiskey in the world and currently sells at a rate of around 4 million cases per year. It has been tweaked over the years to make it mix well with other drinks which explains its popularity in bars and nightclubs. The blend is dominated by some light and crisp grain whiskey but also has a good dollop of heavier pot still whiskey adding some depth. Most of the ageing is done in first fill bourbon casks with only a small proportion in sherry wood. This is a good starting point for anyone wanting to try a typical Irish blend.
