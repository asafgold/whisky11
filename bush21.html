                <p>The 21-year-old Bushmills is the oldest whiskey in the standard distillery range. It is a remarkably fresh and lively tasting malt, given its advanced years. Like the rest of the single malts from Bushmills, this is initially aged in both bourbon and sherry casks. These are then vatted together and married into madeira wine casks for two years. We would go as far to say that this is, thankfully, quite a subtle wood finish. The Bushmills malt is very delicate and elegant and this strikes a nice balance of fruit, spice and sweetness. A top notch whiskey that is dangerously easy to drink!
