                <p>This says Extremely Rare on the label which means about the same as the 'Very Rare' on a bottle of Midleton (ie maybe a just a little bit rare), so perhaps you won't find it in a supermarket. I don't know how much 18 year old whisky Glenmorangie have but I am sure they have enough to keep this going as a regular release. Despite my sarcasm this is actually very, very good. There's some nice sherry finishing here adding some weight and complexity. Like all Glenmorangies it has a polished and refined mouthfeel with some distinct tropical fruit flavours giving it a nice lift.
